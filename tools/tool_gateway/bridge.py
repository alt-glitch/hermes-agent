"""The one module core code imports for connector dispatch.

Every entry point here is TOTAL: it catches its own exceptions and returns a
structured value, because the bridge branch in core dispatch bypasses the
registry's catch-wrap — an exception escaping this module is a bug, full
stop.

Per-entry policy runs through two injected seams: ``local_dispatch`` (local
entries recurse into core dispatch, where scope/probe/hook/middleware gates
fire against each real tool name) and ``pre_dispatch`` (remote entries get
the caller's hook/approval pass against their composed ``connectors__``
names; a block pre-fills that entry's ``USER_DENIED`` slot and its siblings
still run, and an argument REWRITE from that same pass travels to the wire).
The bridge itself only partitions, gates, dispatches, splices.

Dispatch shape (V1, decided 2026-08-25): local entries run via the injected
``local_dispatch``; ALL connector entries travel as ONE gateway execute
request. Split dispatch while approvals pend is a tracked follow-up, not
this code.

Silent degradation (D32): on the availability path (:func:`connector_search_hits`)
every failure returns ``{}`` — signed out, config off, or a dark gateway must
leave tool_search behaving exactly as it does today.

# looking at the payload: ``tool_error`` puts its message under ``error`` but a
# legitimate tool result may also carry an ``error`` field (a provider echo, a
# per-item error list), and sniffing for it both misclassified those results and
# forced an allow-list that dropped every other ``tool_error`` extra. So the
# dispatcher returns ``ok=False`` for the refusals IT raised, and the bridge
# files the payload verbatim in that entry's error slot.
#
# Consequence, deliberate: a real tool that fails inside its own handler still
# comes back ``ok=True``, so it lands in the response slot and counts as a
# success. The failure text reaches the model either way; only the envelope's
# success/error tallies treat it as a completed call.

#   silently blank a call's arguments, so "no change" and "changed to {}" are
#   kept distinct (an empty dict IS a rewrite to no arguments).

# Policy rewrites (sanitization, redaction) are the reason this half exists:
